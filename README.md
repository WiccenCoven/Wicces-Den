## Building

Refer to [the Space Wizards' guide](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup/setting-up-a-development-environment.html) on setting up a development environment for general information, but keep in mind that Einstein Engines is not the same and many things may not apply.
We provide some scripts shown below to make the job easier.
